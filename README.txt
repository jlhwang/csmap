csmap

This is the web map for the Community Safety Alcohol and Other Drug (AOD) Map created using the Leaflet API and OpenStreetMap map tiles. The AOD maps are currently physical pinboard maps displayed in the 28 West building. This project is my attempt at compiling our campus crime data into one visualization.

Incident markers coming.
